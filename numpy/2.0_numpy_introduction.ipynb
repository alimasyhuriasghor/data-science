    "# Introduction To NumPy\n",
    "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is a Python library that provides multidimensional array object (a general term for one or more dimensions in an array), vectorized operations, mathematical logical, shape manipulation, sorting, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of the NumPy package, is the `ndarray` object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data type, with many operations being performed in compiled code for performance. There are several differences between NumPy arrays and Python's built-in `list` type:\n",
    "- NumPy arrays have a fixed size creation.\n",
    "- All of the elements in NumPy arrays required to be of the same data type, thus will be the same size in memory.\n",
    "- NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other type of operations on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and less code compared to Python's built-in `list`.\n",
