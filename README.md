# Howdy! Welcome to My Python Data Science tutorial
This repository contains all of my Python data science learning journey across all trusted sources. Each of the Python data science tutorial will have their own [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) and reference.

#  What is Data Science and what is it used for?
From my opinion, Data science is a study that involves in Math, Programming, Machine learning (ML) to find hidden meaningful data from a dataset (e.g, csv file, excel file, etc).

Data science is really useful among statisticians, who always analyze dataset by using a mathematical knowledge. By leveraging a knowledge of Programming and Machine Learning, statisticians can uncover trends, suggestions, and many more that are useful to both society and companies.
