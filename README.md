# Howdy! Welcome to My Python Data Science tutorial
This repository contains all of my Python data science learning journey across all trusted sources. Each of the Python data science tutorial will have their own [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) and reference.

#  What is Data Science and what is it used for?
From my opinion, Data science is a study that involves in Math, Programming, Machine learning (ML) to find hidden meaningful data from a dataset (e.g, csv file, excel file, etc). By leveraging these knowledeges, statisticians can uncover facts, trends, and any other useful informations.
